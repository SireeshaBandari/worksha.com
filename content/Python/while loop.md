### while LOOP:

You can make a block of code execute over and over again with a while statement. The code in a while clause will be executed as long as the while statementâ€™s condition is True. 

In code, a while statement always consists of the following:

The while keyword

A condition (that is, an expression that evaluates to True or False) 

A colon 

Starting on the next line, an indented block of code (called the while clause)

### syntax:
```python
while(condition):
    (block)
```
for example:
```python
>>> i=0

>>> while i<5:
    print(i)
    i=i+1

0

1

2

3

4

```
