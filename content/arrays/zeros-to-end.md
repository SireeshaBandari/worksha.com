### PROGRAM DESCRIPTION :
WRITE A PROGRAM TO MOVE ALL  zeros‘0’ TO END AND MEAN WHILE ALL OTHER ELEMENTS IN ASCENDING ORDER IN AN ARRAY. 
CONDITIONS :YOU MUST DO THIS IN PLACE WITH OUT MAKING A COPY OF ARRAY.

STEP1: ENTER THE NO OF ELEMENTS.
STEP2: CREATE A EMPTY LIST L=[].
STEP3: USE FOR LOOP DEFINE RANGE OF INPUT .
STEP4: APPEND THE ELEMENTS INTO LIST.
STEP5: SORT   THE GIVEN LIST  USING SORT FUNCTION. 
STEP6: COUNT THE NO OF ZEROS USING COUNT ().
STEP7 : SLICE THE GIVEN LIST USING FUNCTION SLICE  .
 STEP8: PRINT FINAL LIST L2[] .


### PROGRAM:
```python
num=int(input(‘enter the no  of elements’)
L=[]
For i in range (num)
    L.append(int(input()))
    L.sort()
    n=L.count(0)
    L2=L[n:]+L[:n]
print(L2)
```



 ### INPUT/OUTPUT:
INPUT=[0,1,0,3,12]

OUTPUT=[1,3,12,0,0]
### EXPLINATION OF INPUT AND OUTPUT:
INITIALLY THE OUT PUT GIVEN IS[0,1,0,3,12] 
AS PER THE QUESTION WE HAVE TO TAKE ALL ZEROS TO LAST AND ALL OTHER ELEMENTS TO THE FRONT AND ALL NON ZERO ELEMENTS SHOULD  BE IN ASCENDING ORDER  

SO BY THE PROGRAM THE ZEROS CAME TO FIST  AND ALL OTHER WEN TO LAST BY SORTING AND SLICING INITIALLY AN INPUT IS GIVEN THAT [0,1,0,3,12].
GIVEN LIST .
BY THE ABOVE PROCESS THE OUTPUT CAME THAT [1,3,12,0,0].
